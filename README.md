# Watch-Out
The project is an Arduino-made accessory, which can be attached to phones, detecting incoming collisions and alert the phone users when they are busy looking at the phone while walking. We used two ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles from left and right, then we calculated the ratio between those two distances to estimate the direction of the incoming collision. Finally, we had it shown on a black light LCD screen, which is attached to the phone, to alert the user.

Later on, based on the same idea, we developed a collision dectecting stick which supports blind people to walk around.
This time, we used 1 ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to the obstacles in the front, 1 buzzer and 1 servo to warn the stick holder if there is any obstacle at the direction the stick is pointing to.
