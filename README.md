# Watch-Out
The project is an Arduino-made accessory, which can be attached to phones, detecting incoming collisions and alert the phone users when they are busy looking at the phone while walking. We used two ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles from left and right, then we calculated the ratio between those two distances to estimate the direction of the incoming collision. Finally, we had it shown on a black light LCD screen, which is attached to the phone, to alert the user.
